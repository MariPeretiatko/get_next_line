# Get_next_line
The Get Next Line project is an assignment from the 42 school curriculum. The goal of the project is to create a function in the C programming language that reads text from a file line by line. The function should be capable of handling files of arbitrary sizes and returning the next line from the file with each call.

# Functionality:

  - The function should work with file descriptors opened for reading.
  - Each time the function is called, it should return the next line from the file indicated by the file descriptor.
  - The function should be thread-safe.
  - It should properly handle files of arbitrary sizes, including large files.
  - The function should free all allocated memory after use.
